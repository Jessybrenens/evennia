A sealed mausoleum where failure is archived, wealth is preserved, and power is eternal.\nThe rich do not rule—they are frozen in stasis, waiting for their return.\nThe successful do not retire—they are digitized, forever trading in a market that never closes.\nThe unworthy do not rebel—they are corrected or archived.\nAt the heart of Praxia, the AI once known as Peter Thiel still dictates policy, ensuring that Loyalty is Eternity. Deep beneath the city, a single pod hums softly—The Betrayer's Pod—a silent warning that even those who were once favored are not above being corrected.",
