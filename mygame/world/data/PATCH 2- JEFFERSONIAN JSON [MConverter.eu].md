\"overview\": \"Welcome to Jeffersonian, the first fully-optimized human
ecosystem, designed to promote longevity, sustainability, and maximum
biometrics compliance. This is not just a nation---it is a scientific
experiment in human perfection.\nAll food is sustainable, locally
sourced, and engineered for optimal nutrition.\nAll citizens are
monitored via real-time Health Scores, ensuring peak performance.\nWork
is fulfilling and natural, meaning every citizen contributes through
personalized, AI-determined agrarian labor.\nNo one is unhealthy. No one
is unproductive. No one is unhappy.\nJeffersonian\'s residents live in
Health Optimization Communities (HOCs), where agriculture meets
data-driven wellness. Everyone has a purpose, carefully calculated for
their biological needs. Those who fail to meet their Wellness Metrics
are sent to Rejuvenation Centers for \\health correction.\\\nIt\'s not
forced labor---it\'s participatory longevity!\",
