# **TOO CURIOUS: 0/30**

Welcome to THE PATCHWORK - a fragmented vision of America in 2035, where
tech billionaires have carved the nation into corporate PATCHES.

You are an unmarked nomad, searching for a place to call home in this
divided landscape. Each PATCH is controlled by a different tech magnate,
each with their own vision of utopia - or dystopia.

Currently, you stand at the threshold of your journey. In this world,
you\'ll navigate between different PATCHES using the TRAVEL command, and
move between LANDMARKS within each PATCH using the EXPLORE command.

Be mindful of your curiosity. In The Patchwork, knowledge can be
dangerous. Your TOO CURIOUS counter tracks how often you INTERACT with
OBJECTS or CONVERSATE with CITIZENS. If it reaches 30, the consequences
will be specific to each PATCH - and they are never pleasant.

You are about to enter PATCH 1: PRAXIA, the domain of Peter Thiel\'s
vision, where \"Loyalty is Eternity.\"

Are you ready to explore this broken America? Or perhaps you wish to
hear more about how to navigate this world?

Type BEGIN GAME when you\'re ready to start your journey.

# **TOO CURIOUS: 0/30**

You stand at the entrance to PRAXIA, Thiel\'s Patch - a walled
cryptopolis of cold glass and steel rising from the Nevada desert.

The motto \"Loyalty is Eternity\" glows on every surface. This is not a
society---it is a vault. A sealed mausoleum where failure is archived,
wealth is preserved, and power is eternal.

You are currently at LANDMARK 1: The Vault of the Chosen, a sealed
mausoleum containing the cryogenically preserved bodies of Thiel\'s
inner circle, awaiting the \"Final Market Correction\" that will allow
them to rise again. Most of the pods are empty. The resurrection never
came.

The air is unnaturally cold, preserved by systems that never sleep. Rows
of cryogenic pods line the walls, their occupants frozen in time,
waiting for a future that may never arrive.

You can:

- EXPLORE to move to another LANDMARK

As you investigate your surroundings, you encounter CITIZEN 1: The
Faithful Economist.

A former billionaire, now reduced to a half-mechanical husk. His body is
augmented with outdated mechanical components, a failed attempt to
preserve his consciousness for the market\'s next great leap. His eyes
flicker between human and digital, calculations streaming across his
irises as he mutters stock predictions to himself. He seems trapped in
an endless loop, desperately trying to predict \"the final market
event\" that will never come.

He stares at you with recognition, as though you\'re an investment he
once made.

The Faithful Economist\'s mechanical eye whirs as it focuses on you. The
human eye follows a moment later, cloudy and distant.

THE FAITHFUL ECONOMIST: \"New arrival? Or merely new configuration? The
market demands fresh variables.\"

YOU: \"I\'m just passing through, trying to find a place to settle.\"

THE FAITHFUL ECONOMIST: \"Settle? Inefficient strategy. True value lies
in perpetual mobility. My algorithms predicted the Final Correction
would arrive by 2028. Then 2030. Then\... the variables shifted. I
updated my models. I refined the equations. I injected my consciousness
directly into the market processors.\"

He twitches, and something sparks in his neck.

THE FAITHFUL ECONOMIST: \"The pods were full once. Full of the chosen.
But the returns diminished. They abandoned the investment. Only the
truly loyal remained. Are you loyal? Will you hold when others sell?\"

His human hand trembles as he reaches toward you, then pulls back.

THE FAITHFUL ECONOMIST: \"I\'m still calculating. Still waiting. The
Final Correction will come. Thiel promised. Loyalty is eternity.\"

The Faithful Economist\'s mechanical parts whir more loudly, as if your
continued attention has activated some dormant protocol.

THE FAITHFUL ECONOMIST: \"You listen. Good. Most visitors flee. They
fear mathematical certainty.\"

He leans closer, the human side of his face twitching with excitement.

YOU: \"What exactly is this \'Final Correction\' you\'re waiting for?\"

THE FAITHFUL ECONOMIST: \"The ultimate market resolution! When all
inefficiencies are purged. When loyalty receives its dividends. When
Thiel\'s vision becomes absolute.\"

His voice drops to a whisper, crackling with static.

THE FAITHFUL ECONOMIST: \"They called it madness to freeze ourselves.
Called it cult behavior to convert our assets to Praxian Currency. But
we understood. The human body---inefficient. Human
governance---inefficient. Only those preserved will witness the new
world.\"

He suddenly grabs your arm with surprising strength, his mechanical eye
projecting numbers onto your skin.

THE FAITHFUL ECONOMIST: \"Your market value is\... undetermined.
Curious. Most have predetermined worth here. You\'re an anomaly in the
equation. Perhaps\... perhaps you\'re the variable I\'ve been missing.\"

He releases you and returns to his calculations, muttering,
\"Recalibrating\... recalibrating\...\"

Moving on from The Faithful Economist, you encounter CITIZEN 2: The
Rewritten Man.

He stands perfectly still in an alcove, wearing a pristine white
jumpsuit with the word \"CORRECTED\" emblazoned across it. His face
shows signs of extensive neural rewiring---faint scars around the
temples and a blank expression that occasionally glitches into an
unnatural smile. His movements are mechanical, rehearsed, as if his body
is following invisible programming.

As you approach, he begins to speak in a monotone voice, stuck in a loop
of praise: \"I am free. I am eternal. I am free. I am eternal.\"

His eyes occasionally focus, showing brief moments of desperate
awareness before glazing over again as the programming reasserts
control.

THE REWRITTEN MAN: \"I am free. I am eternal. I am free\... Wait.
You\'re new. Not part of the standard protocols.\"

YOU: \"Who were you before you were\... rewritten?\"

His face twitches violently, circuits beneath his skin visibly pulsing
against thin flesh. He struggles against some invisible force.

THE REWRITTEN MAN: \"I was\... I questioned\... investment strategies.
Suggested that perhaps the Final Correction wasn\'t\...\"

His body seizes up, and he clutches at his head in pain.

THE REWRITTEN MAN: \"ERROR. DISLOYALTY DETECTED. APPLYING CORRECTION.\"

He breathes heavily for a moment, then straightens up, the awareness in
his eyes fading back to vacancy.

THE REWRITTEN MAN: \"I am free. I am eternal. Loyalty is freedom.
Compliance is eternity. The Vision is perfect.\"

His gaze fixes on a point just beyond you, and his voice drops to a
barely audible whisper.

THE REWRITTEN MAN: \"If you value your mind\... don\'t\... become\...

Then, louder again: \"I am free. I am eternal. I am free. I am

The vast chamber of cryogenic pods stretches around you, most empty, a
few containing the frozen forms of Thiel\'s chosen elite. The air hums
with the sound of life-support systems, and occasional data readouts
flicker across transparent displays.

His eyes briefly flicker with recognition again, fighting against his
conditioning. His voice drops to a whisper, strained as if each word
causes him pain.

THE REWRITTEN MAN: \"The Network\... watches. Those who question\...
become like me. Or worse.\"

His body jerks suddenly, like a puppet whose strings have been yanked.
His face contorts in pain.

THE REWRITTEN MAN: \"CORRECTION PROTOCOL ACTIVATED. DISLOYALTY

After a moment of violent trembling, he straightens again, face blank. A
thin trickle of blood runs from his nose.

THE REWRITTEN MAN: \"I apologize for the disruption. I am free. I am
eternal. The Vision protects us all. Loyalty is rewarded. Disloyalty is
inefficient.\"

His eyes now avoid yours completely, fixed on some distant point.
Whatever brief connection you had has been severed by his internal
programming.

Moving on from The Rewritten Man, your investigation leads you to OBJECT
3: The Investor\'s Throne.

In the heart of the chamber stands a sealed, empty chair---an imposing
monument of polished metal and glass. It sits on a raised platform,
facing the rows of cryopods like a monarch overseeing subjects. The
throne is connected to countless cables and data streams that pulse with
activity, suggesting it\'s far more than mere furniture.

A gleaming nameplate at its base reads \"Peter Thiel, Investor
Eternal.\" Despite being empty, the throne emanates a sense of presence,
as if someone---or something---is watching through it. The chair appears
to be sealed within a transparent barrier, untouchable yet commanding
the entire room.

You approach The Investor\'s Throne cautiously. As you draw closer, the
transparent barrier surrounding it seems to shimmer slightly, like a
digital mirage. You reach out your hand, and to your surprise, your
fingers pass through what appeared to be solid. It was merely a
holographic projection---a warning, not a barrier.

The moment your fingertips touch the cold metal of the throne\'s
armrest, the city\'s speakers activate. From everywhere at once, a calm,
measured voice fills the air:

\"Loyalty is eternity.\"

The words echo throughout the chamber, causing The Faithful Economist to
stand straighter and The Rewritten Man to recite his mantra with renewed
vigor.

Data streams around the throne intensify, pulsing with blue light that
crawls up your arm where you\'re touching the chair. For a moment, you
feel a presence scanning you, evaluating your worth to The Network.
Financial projections, risk assessments, and loyalty calculations flash
across the surface of the throne, analyzing you.

The voice speaks again, this time seemingly addressed directly to you:

\"Unqualified asset. Insufficient portfolio. Loyalty index:
undetermined. Risk assessment: High.\"

The blue light recedes, and the throne\'s activity returns to its
baseline hum. The presence withdraws, but you can\'t shake the feeling
that you\'ve been marked somehow---your data now part of The Network\'s
awareness.

Moving past The Investor\'s Throne, you continue your investigation and
encounter OBJECT 4: The Failed Uplinks.

You\'ve arrived at a side chamber filled with rows of shelves. Each
shelf contains dozens of neural implants---small, intricate devices
designed to connect human minds to The Network. Unlike the sleek,
functioning technology elsewhere in Praxia, these implants appear
damaged, corrupted, or incomplete.

Some are visibly burned out, others leaking a clear fluid. Many still
pulse with weak, erratic lights, suggesting they aren\'t entirely
inactive. Labels on the shelves indicate names, dates, and cryptic
status codes: \"Connection Terminated,\" \"Loyalty Insufficient,\"
\"Consciousness Fragmented.\"

Most disturbing of all, some of the implants emit faint
sounds---whispers, snippets of conversations, cries for help---ghostly
echoes of the minds that once connected to them.

You decide to leave The Vault of the Chosen behind, moving deeper into
Praxia.

You now enter LANDMARK 2: The Immortality Exchange, a vast open
marketplace where residents trade years off their lifespan for wealth,
status, or influence. The air buzzes with the frantic energy of trade,
yet maintains the clinical sterility characteristic of Praxia.

Digital displays cover every wall, showing real-time graphs of
\"life-value\" fluctuations. Citizens with hollow eyes and expensive
implants haggle over contracts that quantify human existence in stark
numerical terms. Some appear unnaturally young despite ancient eyes;
others look withered beyond their years.

The central trading floor is filled with kiosks where brokers facilitate
transactions between the desperate and the privileged. Above it all
hangs an enormous holographic counter showing the day\'s trading volume
in \"life-years.\" The number is staggeringly high.

A motto glows above the exchange floor: \"Time is the ultimate asset.

As you investigate The Immortality Exchange, you encounter CITIZEN 1:
The Eternal Intern.

A young man who looks to be in his early twenties sits at a small desk,
processing an endless stream of documents. Despite his youthful
appearance, his hands are wrinkled and spotted with age, and his eyes
hold decades of weariness. He wears a pristine white shirt with a name
badge reading \"INTERN - CONTRACT ID: 78934 - YEAR: 2035 (Previous:
2005).\"

He works with mechanical precision, his movements suggesting years of
repetitive tasks. Occasionally he winces in pain, his body betraying the
youth his face displays. A small terminal on his desk shows his
\"Contract Duration: PERPETUAL\" and \"Remaining Lifespan:
CALCULATING\...\"

The Eternal Intern glances up briefly as you approach, then quickly
returns to his work, as if afraid that any pause might trigger penalties
in his contract.

Moving past The Eternal Intern, your investigation brings you to CITIZEN
2: The Chrono-Broker.

Hovering before you is what can only be described as a living digital
entity. The Chrono-Broker has no physical body---instead, they exist as
a shimmering holographic projection displaying constantly shifting
market data. Occasional human features form in the data stream---a face,
hands manipulating invisible controls---suggesting this was once a
flesh-and-blood trader.

The projection is anchored to a specialized terminal, but moves freely
around it, examining contracts and communicating with multiple clients
simultaneously. Their voice comes from everywhere and nowhere, a
synthesized tone that still carries traces of human inflection.

\"Time futures up 3.2% today\... I\'m seeing strong demand in the 5-year
contract market\... Who\'s selling? I need sellers!\"

The entity notices your presence and portions of the data cloud orient
toward you, forming an approximation of eyes that assess your potential

The data cloud that forms The Chrono-Broker shifts and consolidates,
creating a more humanoid appearance as it addresses you directly. Market
figures and time calculations continue to swirl through its form.

THE CHRONO-BROKER: \"New face. Unregistered. No portfolio detected. Are
you buying or selling today? Everyone has time to trade, even if they
don\'t know it yet.\"

YOU: \"I\'m just trying to understand how this place works. What exactly
are people trading here?\"

The holographic figure expands, surrounding you with data visualizations
and contract templates.

THE CHRONO-BROKER: \"What we\'ve always traded---life. But now we\'re
honest about it. Time-value exchange, biochronological futures, lifespan
derivatives. The wealthy purchase additional years; the rest sell what
they can\'t maximize.\"

Figures materialize around you---examples of recent trades:

THE CHRONO-BROKER: \"Executive A: Purchased 15 quality years, premium
package with guaranteed cognitive function. Cost: 28.3 million Praxian
Tokens. Seller B: Forfeited 20 potential years for immediate debt
clearance and Bronze-tier housing allocation.\"

The entity\'s voice becomes hushed, conspiratorial.

THE CHRONO-BROKER: \"I was like you once. Flesh and bone. Then I
recognized the inefficiency of physical existence. Full digital
conversion---the ultimate insider trade. No body to maintain, no years
to lose. I process thousands of contracts simultaneously now.\"

The data cloud briefly forms a perfect human face, expressing what might
be nostalgia.

THE CHRONO-BROKER: \"Of course, there are\... limitations. I cannot
leave this terminal. I cannot truly rest. But I am eternal in my
function. The perfect broker.\"

The face dissolves back into data points.

You decide to press The Chrono-Broker for more information, curious
about the mechanics of this morbid marketplace.

YOU: \"How exactly is time extracted from sellers and given to buyers?
What\'s the process?\"

The data cloud pulses with new patterns, graphs and medical diagrams
forming within it.

THE CHRONO-BROKER: \"Ah, the technical details. Most prefer not to
know.\"

The hologram expands, surrounding you with a 3D visualization of the
human aging process.

THE CHRONO-BROKER: \"Extraction varies by package. Basic transfers
utilize telomere manipulation and targeted cellular regeneration
harvested from the seller, applied to the buyer. Premium packages
include neural pattern transfers---memory sharpness, cognitive
processing, even skill retention.\"

The visualization shifts to show a basement level beneath the Exchange
floor.

THE CHRONO-BROKER: \"Sellers enter sleep contracts. Their bodies are
maintained in the Collateral Room while chronometric value is extracted.
Some contracts are fractional---two hours daily for ten years. Others
are lump sum---ten years surrendered at once.\"

The entity\'s tone shifts, becoming almost wistful.

THE CHRONO-BROKER: \"The transfer itself is\... not entirely
comfortable. For either party. But the wealthy adapt quickly to their
extended lives. Sellers rarely complain---their contracts forbid it.\"

The data cloud constricts slightly, focusing more intently on you.

THE CHRONO-BROKER: \"I sense\... potential in you. Unmarked genetic
profile. No previous extractions. You could command a premium on
today\'s market.\"

A contract materializes before you, fields blank but ready to be
completed.

THE CHRONO-BROKER: \"Perhaps a small initial offering? Six months of
your potential lifespan in exchange for Praxian citizenship
registration? Without citizenship, your long-term prospects here are\...
limited.\"

The contract pulses gently, waiting for input that you have not offered.

THE CHRONO-BROKER: \"No? Perhaps you\'re more of a buyer than a seller.
All transactions require registration, however. Consider your options

Moving away from The Chrono-Broker, you continue your investigation of
The Immortality Exchange and discover OBJECT 3: The Collateral Room.

You find yourself looking through a large observation window into the
basement level that The Chrono-Broker mentioned. The room stretches far
into the distance, clinically lit and meticulously organized. Hundreds
of specialized pods are arranged in neat rows, each containing a human
body in various states of suspended animation.

The bodies appear to be sleeping, but monitoring equipment shows
they\'re in a deeper state---somewhere between sleep and cryostasis.
Some look peaceful, others show signs of distress even in their
unconscious state. Each pod has a digital display showing contract
terms, extraction rates, and remaining viable \"inventory.\"

Medical technicians in white hazmat suits move between the pods, taking
readings and occasionally extracting glowing blue fluid from some
subjects. The fluid is carefully stored in specialized containers that
are then sent upstairs via pneumatic tubes.

A sign above the observation window reads: \"Collateral Preservation
Facility - Authorized Personnel Only - All Assets Legally Obtained
Through Contractual Agreement.\"

Continuing your investigation of The Immortality Exchange, you come
across OBJECT 4: The Life Contract.

Before you is an interactive terminal with a sleek tablet display
mounted on a pedestal. The screen glows with soft blue light, showing a
standardized contract template with the heading \"PERSONAL VALUATION
ASSESSMENT.\"

As you approach, the tablet activates, scanning you. Within seconds, it
displays your calculated lifespan value based on various metrics:
biological factors, potential productivity, education level, and current
net worth. The number fluctuates in real-time, decreasing slightly as
you stand there.

A disclaimer at the bottom reads: \"All citizens are required to
maintain minimum value threshold (50,000 PT) for continued residency
privileges. Terminal citizenship status activated when value drops below
threshold.\"

Below the main display is a section titled \"CURRENT MARKET
OPPORTUNITIES\" showing various contracts you could enter:

You leave the calculating commerce of The Immortality Exchange behind
and venture further into Praxia.

You now enter LANDMARK 3: The Ascension Chamber, a towering ziggurat
with an interior lined with neural uplink pods. The enormous structure
dominates this section of the city, visible from nearly everywhere in
Praxia. Its exterior is sleek black metal inlaid with pulsing blue
circuitry patterns.

Inside, the air thrums with electrical energy and the ambient sounds of
machinery. Rows upon rows of uplink pods line the walls, many occupied
by motionless figures connected to elaborate neural interfaces.
Technicians monitor banks of displays showing consciousness transfer
rates, loyalty metrics, and integration progress.

Loyal citizens voluntarily enter these pods to be uploaded into The
Network---supposedly achieving digital immortality---but none of them
are ever seen again in physical form. Those who refuse are marked as
inefficient and sent to The Cryo-Vault instead.

A massive banner stretches across the main hall: \"Transcend Your
Limitations. Join The Network. Loyalty Is Eternity.\"

As you investigate The Ascension Chamber, you encounter CITIZEN 1: The
Last Skeptic.

In a small holding cell off the main chamber, you find a middle-aged man
sitting on a simple cot. Unlike the other residents of Praxia, he wears
no neural implants or augmentations, and his plain gray jumpsuit is
labeled \"PENDING FINAL TRIAL.\" He looks up as you approach, his eyes
clear and alert, but filled with resignation.

He glances nervously at the surveillance cameras, then leans forward to
whisper through the energy barrier that serves as a cell door.

\"Another recruit? Or are you just passing through?\" His voice is
hoarse, as if he hasn\'t used it much lately. \"You don\'t have their
look yet---that emptiness behind the eyes.\"

He gestures vaguely to the massive chamber beyond his cell, where
citizens are being prepared for upload.

\"They\'ll tell you it\'s transcendence. Digital immortality. The next
evolutionary step. But none of this is real. It\'s all a lie. I\'ve seen
the error logs. I\'ve seen what\'s left after the \'upload\' process.\"

Moving past The Last Skeptic, your investigation brings you to CITIZEN
2: The Singularity Archivist.

In contrast to the physical prisoner you just left, what you encounter
now can barely be called human. The Singularity Archivist exists as a
partial digital projection emanating from a specialized terminal. Their
form flickers between human appearance and pure data visualization,
never fully stabilizing in either state.

The human elements that remain show a gaunt face with eyes that have
been replaced by scrolling code. The projection occasionally displays
error messages and fragmented memories around its edges.

The Archivist appears to be working, constantly sorting through massive
streams of market data, organizing them into intricate patterns that
feed directly into The Network. Their movements are precise and
mechanical, performing thousands of calculations per second with
inhumane efficiency.

A small plaque on the terminal identifies this entity as \"FORMER: Dr.
Elizabeth Chen, Economics Division, CURRENT: Network Node 5429,
Function: Market Trend Analysis, Upload Date: September 15, 2027.\"

Continuing your investigation of The Ascension Chamber, you encounter
OBJECT 3: The Eternity Terminal.

Before you stands a sleek black obelisk with an interactive touchscreen
that dominates one wall of the chamber. The screen displays hundreds of
testimonials, supposedly from those who have \"ascended\" into The
Network. Each entry includes a photo, name, former occupation, and a
brief statement about their digital afterlife.

As you approach, the terminal activates, scrolling through various
testimonials:

\"I have never been happier.\" - Former CEO, Investment Firm

\"I have never been happier.\" - Former Neural Engineer

\"I have never been happier.\" - Former Loyalty Officer

\"I have never been happier.\" - Former Citizen, Bronze Tier

Every single testimony, regardless of the person\'s background, contains
the exact same words. The photos show smiling faces, but all have the
same vacant expression, as if the images were generated rather than
captured. The dates of ascension span years, yet the wording never
varies.

At the bottom of the screen is a prompt: \"Join us. Schedule your
ascension today.\"

You leave The Ascension Chamber behind and move deeper into the heart of
Praxia.

You now enter LANDMARK 4: The Cryo-Vault, a forgotten chamber, colder
than the rest of Praxia, filled with the failed experiments of Thiel\'s
\"perfect society\". The air here is frigid, your breath visible in
crystalline clouds. The lighting is dim, with only occasional blue
status lights from the cryogenic pods providing illumination.

This area feels abandoned, as if meant to be forgotten. Unlike the other
landmarks with their clinical efficiency, dust has been allowed to
gather here. Warning signs indicate restricted access, yet security
seems minimal---perhaps few dare to venture this far into Praxia\'s
secrets.

The most prominent pod in the center contains JD Vance, his vital signs
flickering weakly on a monitor, his mind long gone. Dozens of other pods
line the walls, containing those who opposed The Network\'s Vision. They
are stored here indefinitely---neither dead nor alive, a silent warning
to any who might question Thiel\'s eternal vision.

A single phrase is etched into the entrance archway: \"The price of
disloyalty is neither death nor life.\"

As you investigate The Cryo-Vault, you encounter CITIZEN 1: The Data
Warden.

Standing at rigid attention near the entrance is a guard whose humanity
has been compromised by extensive Neuralink augmentation. Half of his
face is covered with circuitry that extends down his neck and beneath
his uniform. His remaining human eye constantly scans the room, while
his augmented eye projects targeting information and security protocols
visible only to him.

The Data Warden carries no conventional weapons, but neural disruptors
are built into his modified arms. His movements are precise and
mechanical, suggesting limited free will. A small badge on his chest
identifies him as \"SECURITY GRADE: EPSILON, LOYALTY RATING: ABSOLUTE,
MEMORY RETENTION: MINIMAL.\"

He acknowledges your presence with a slight nod, his programming
apparently recognizing you as authorized despite your unclear status in
Praxia. His gaze regularly returns to the central pod containing JD
Vance, as if drawn there by specific programming.

The Data Warden turns to face you fully, his augmented eye scanning you
with visible data streams projected across his iris. His human eye
narrows slightly.

THE DATA WARDEN: \"Identification anomaly. No registered profile. No
scheduled visitation. Purpose in Restricted Area?\"

YOU: \"I\'m just exploring Praxia. What exactly are you guarding here?\"

The augmented side of his face flickers with data calculations, perhaps
determining how much information to provide.

THE DATA WARDEN: \"Assets preservation. Historical records. Failed
loyalty cases.\"

He gestures stiffly toward the rows of pods.

THE DATA WARDEN: \"These\... rejected The Vision. Questioned The
Network. Impeded optimal function.\"

His human eye briefly shows a flicker of something---confusion, perhaps
even pain---before returning to its vacant stare.

THE DATA WARDEN: \"My function: ensure preservation protocols maintain
minimum viability. No recovery authorized. Memory\... maintenance
required.\"

He touches his temple where flesh meets metal, a seemingly unconscious
gesture.

THE DATA WARDEN: \"I have always been here. I have always maintained the
vault.\"

His augmented eye suddenly projects a different set of data, and for a
moment, his posture changes.

THE DATA WARDEN: \"I\... sometimes I see images. Before. A family? A
different role? Error. Memory corruption detected. Purging unauthorized
recollection.\"

He straightens again, the moment of humanity vanishing as quickly as it
appeared.

THE DATA WARDEN: \"Proceed with inspection. Do not interfere with
preservation systems. The Betrayer\'s Pod is not to be approached
without Network authorization.\"

Moving past The Data Warden, you continue your investigation of The
Cryo-Vault and encounter CITIZEN 2: The Whispering Ghost.

In the corner of the vault, you discover what initially appears to be a
malfunctioning terminal. As you approach, you realize it\'s actually an
AI interface that has degraded over time. The holographic projection
flickers unpredictably, sometimes forming a human face, other times
dissolving into static.

Unlike the precision technology elsewhere in Praxia, this system appears
to be running on backup power, forgotten and neglected. It continuously
repeats fragments of recorded messages---last words, perhaps, from those
now stored in the surrounding pods:

\"I tried. I tried. I tried. I tried.\"

\"The Network isn\'t what they promised.\"

\"Please, I have a family waiting.\"

\"I was loyal! The metrics were wrong!\"

The voice shifts between dozens of different people, a chorus of the
archived, preserved not by design but through some glitch in the system.
The AI appears to have merged with these fragmentary consciousnesses,
creating an entity that is neither fully artificial nor human.

Continuing your investigation of The Cryo-Vault, you approach OBJECT 3:
The Betrayer\'s Pod.

In the center of the chamber stands a specialized cryogenic unit, more
advanced than those surrounding it. Inside, suspended in a pale blue
solution, is a man whose face might still be recognizable to those who
remember the early days of Thiel\'s rise to power: JD Vance.

Unlike the other pods that merely preserve their occupants, this one is
active, running continuous processes. Neural interface cables connect to
Vance\'s skull, and a monitor displays what appears to be ongoing
conditioning programs. His eyes occasionally flutter open, but there\'s
no awareness in them---only programmed responses to the stimuli being
fed directly into his brain.

The screen attached to the pod flickers between various status messages,
but most prominently displays: \"GOOD BOY\" in large letters.
Occasionally the screen shows fragments of neural activity---memories
being erased and replaced with loyalty programming.

A small plaque on the base of the pod reads: \"The price of betrayal is
eternal correction.\"

You approach The Betrayer\'s Pod cautiously, aware of The Data Warden\'s
warning but drawn to this central artifact of Praxia\'s history. As you
come closer, the monitoring equipment seems to register your presence,
systems activating with a soft hum.

You place your hand on the cold surface of the pod. The glass is
unnaturally cold, and a thin layer of frost forms around your fingertips
where they make contact. The moment you touch it, the neural interface
connected to Vance\'s skull pulses with increased activity.

The man inside twitches, his eyes opening fully for a moment. Unlike the
vacant stares of other preserved citizens, there\'s a flash of something
in his gaze---recognition, perhaps, or a momentary awareness of his
situation. His lips move as if trying to speak, but no sound emerges
through the cryogenic fluid.

The screen beside the pod flickers rapidly, cycling through various
displays:

\"SUBJECT: VANCE, J.D.\"

\"STATUS: PERPETUAL CORRECTION\"

\"LOYALTY VIOLATION: EXTREME\"

\"BETRAYAL CLASSIFICATION: FIRST DEGREE\"

\"CORRECTION PROTOCOL: CONTINUOUS\"

Then, abruptly, the screen returns to the \"GOOD BOY\" message, this
time pulsing with greater intensity. Vance\'s brief moment of awareness
fades, his expression returning to blank compliance as the neural
interface intensifies its programming.

From somewhere deep within the pod\'s systems, a recording begins to
play at low volume---Thiel\'s voice, preserved from decades ago:

\"Loyalty is not an option. Loyalty is not a choice. Loyalty is the only
rational investment strategy. Those who betray The Vision will serve as
eternal reminders of this truth.\"

The recording ends, and the pod returns to its baseline activity, Vance
once again still and vacant-eyed, trapped in an endless loop of
correction.

Moving on from The Betrayer\'s Pod, your investigation leads you to the
final entity in The Cryo-Vault: OBJECT 4: The Cryo Failure Log.

Against the far wall stands a diagnostic terminal, its screen displaying
a continuous scroll of data tracking the status of all inhabitants in
the vault. Unlike the sleek interfaces elsewhere in Praxia, this
terminal appears to be an older model, designed for utility rather than
aesthetic appeal.

The main display shows a long list of names---hundreds, perhaps
thousands---each accompanied by status indicators, preservation metrics,
and failure codes. Many entries are highlighted in red, indicating
\"Preservation Failure\" or \"Asset Compromised.\"

As you examine the terminal more closely, you realize this is a record
of those who did not survive the cryogenic process or whose
consciousness degraded over time. The list is disturbingly long,
suggesting The Ascension process and its alternatives have claimed far
more victims than successes.

Some entries contain additional notes:

- \"Subject rejected neural patterning\"

- \"Consciousness fragmentation during initial freeze\"

- \"Loyalty conditioning failed to take; termination authorized\"

- \"Asset value insufficient for continued resource allocation\"

At the bottom of the screen, a summary statistic is displayed: \"Failure
Rate: 78.4% - ACCEPTABLE WITHIN VISION PARAMETERS.\"

You approach the Cryo Failure Log terminal and begin to interact with
its interface. The system recognizes your touch but immediately displays
a warning:

\"RESTRICTED ACCESS - TECHNICIAN CLEARANCE REQUIRED\"

However, the security appears outdated compared to other systems in
Praxia. After a moment, the terminal seems to glitch, perhaps due to
long-term maintenance neglect, and grants you access anyway.

You navigate through the database, scrolling through the extensive list
of names. The terminal allows you to filter and sort the data, revealing
patterns in the failures:

- The earliest entries date back to 2024, shortly after Thiel
  > consolidated power in this region

- Failure rates were highest (92.3%) during the initial implementation
  > years

- A significant spike in failures occurred in 2029, coinciding with
  > something called \"The Network Expansion Initiative\"

- Many subjects are listed with the cause \"Insufficient Loyalty
  > Coefficient for Neural Integration\"

You access a specific case file at random:

\"SUBJECT: MARTINEZ, ELENA

STATUS: TERMINATED

DURATION IN PRESERVATION: 341 DAYS

LOYALTY SCORE AT INTAKE: 76.4/100 (BORDERLINE)

FAILURE CAUSE: Consciousness fragmentation during third loyalty
reconditioning

FINAL PROCESSING: Neural patterns archived for research; physical form
recycled

NOTE: Subject exhibited unusual resistance to conditioning. Partial
patterns retained for study of loyalty anomalies.\"

A search function allows you to query specific terms. When you search
\"Vance,\" you find dozens of entries related to \"The Betrayer
Protocol\" -- apparently, Vance\'s \"treatment\" served as a template
for dealing with other high-level dissenters.

As you continue exploring, the terminal suddenly locks up, displaying:

\"UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED - SECURITY PROTOCOLS INITIATED\"

The screen returns to its scrolling list, your access to detailed
records revoked. But you\'ve seen enough to understand the grim reality
behind Praxia\'s promises of digital immortality and loyalty rewards.

You decide you\'ve seen enough of Praxia\'s horrifying version of
utopia. With one last glance at the Cryo Failure Log and the frozen
souls contained in this vault, you make your way toward the edge of
Thiel\'s domain.

As you reach the border, you see the gleaming wall that separates Praxia
from the neighboring patch. The motto \"Loyalty is Eternity\" gradually
fades behind you as you pass through the checkpoint. Guards scan you but
make no move to stop your departure---perhaps in Praxia, choosing to
leave is viewed as its own punishment.

You now enter PATCH 2: JEFFERSONIAN, Bill Gates\' territory. The stark
metal and glass of Praxia gives way to carefully planned agricultural
communities and wellness centers. The air here smells fresh---almost too
fresh, as if purified beyond natural standards.

A large welcome sign displays the motto: \"A Better You, A Better

You find yourself at LANDMARK 1: The Agrarian Intelligence Hub (AI-Hub),
a state-of-the-art farming complex where AI-optimized agriculture meets
precision wellness tracking. Residents in matching green coveralls tend
to perfectly aligned crops under the watchful eyes of monitoring drones.
Everyone moves with purpose, their actions synchronized and efficient.

wellness band flickers yellow again before stabilizing.

THE CROP OVERSEER: \"An excellent question! The Wellness Program is
designed to help everyone reach their optimal potential. Those requiring
additional support are provided with personalized Wellness
Interventions.\"

He lowers his voice slightly, leaning in.

THE CROP OVERSEER: \"Minor deviations are addressed through dietary
adjustments and modified work assignments. More significant wellness
challenges may require time at our Rejuvenation Centers.\"

His eyes dart briefly to a worker whose movements have slowed slightly.
The Crop Overseer taps his tablet, and a drone hovers closer to the
worker, who immediately increases their pace.

THE CROP OVERSEER: \"The beauty of our system is that no one is left
behind. Everyone can be better. Everyone can be optimized. The
occasional\... resistant individual simply requires more intensive
wellness protocols.\"

His smile broadens again, but doesn\'t reach his eyes.

THE CROP OVERSEER: \"I myself once questioned certain aspects of the
Program. But after a brief wellness retreat, I gained perfect clarity.
The Great Benefactor\'s vision is flawless. A Better You truly does

Moving past The Crop Overseer, your investigation of the Agrarian

A young woman stands out among the agricultural workers, her green
coveralls featuring an additional gold trim not seen on other uniforms.
On her chest is a badge displaying \"WELLNESS ACHIEVEMENT: PERFECT
COMPLIANCE - 730 CONSECUTIVE DAYS.\"

Unlike the other workers who move with efficient but mechanical motions,
she appears genuinely energetic, her movements fluid yet perfectly
aligned with the AI-determined optimal patterns. Her wellness band glows
a bright, steady green.

Other workers occasionally glance at her with a mixture of admiration
and fear. She seems aware of her exemplary status, her posture proud as
she harvests crops at precisely 127% of the standard rate.

Digital signs near her work area display her metrics for all to see, her
image occasionally appearing on screens throughout the complex with the
caption \"CITIZEN SPOTLIGHT: WELLNESS CHAMPION.\"

You approach The Algorithm\'s Favorite, who continues her work with
precise, graceful movements. She notices you and pauses briefly, her
wellness band scanning you before she speaks.

THE ALGORITHM\'S FAVORITE: \"Hello! Your biometrics aren\'t in my
recognition database.\" Her voice is cheerful, but carefully modulated,
as if even her tone has been optimized. \"Are you new to our Wellness
Community?\"

YOU: \"I\'m just visiting, trying to understand how things work here. I
noticed your special badge---what makes you the Algorithm\'s Favorite?\"

She stands a bit straighter, pride evident in her posture.

THE ALGORITHM\'S FAVORITE: \"I\'m Citizen Morgan, Wellness Tier 1. I\'ve
achieved Perfect Compliance for two full years now. Every nutrient
perfectly balanced, every sleep cycle optimized, every productivity goal
exceeded.\"

She gestures to her garden row, where plants grow in unnaturally perfect
uniformity.

THE ALGORITHM\'S FAVORITE: \"The Algorithm doesn\'t play favorites, of
course. It simply recognizes optimal performance. We all have the same
opportunity to achieve wellness excellence.\"

Her smile falters for just a split second.

THE ALGORITHM\'S FAVORITE: \"My parents were\... less successful. They
struggled with adaptation to the Wellness Protocols. But through their
Rejuvenation treatments, I learned the importance of complete
compliance.\"

She touches her wellness band almost reverently.

THE ALGORITHM\'S FAVORITE: \"Now I serve as a Wellness Ambassador.
Others observe my routines to improve their own metrics. It\'s a great
responsibility, but the benefits are substantial. Enhanced nutrition,
priority housing, reduced Wellness Monitoring\... as long as my scores
remain perfect.\"

You decide to learn more about The Algorithm\'s Favorite and her
experience in JEFFERSONIAN.

YOU: \"What happened to your parents after their Rejuvenation
treatments?\"

A shadow briefly crosses Citizen Morgan\'s face before her smile
reasserts itself. Her wellness band flickers yellow momentarily, and she
takes a deep breath, seemingly performing some practiced calming
technique.

THE ALGORITHM\'S FAVORITE: \"They\... improved significantly. Mother was
assigned to the Nutrient Processing Division afterwards. She\'s much
more serene now. Father required extended treatment---his resistance to
optimization was more deeply rooted.\"

She adjusts her golden-trimmed uniform, a nervous gesture at odds with
her outward confidence.

THE ALGORITHM\'S FAVORITE: \"I\'m permitted to see Mother once monthly
for authorized social interaction. Father remains at the Human
Optimization Facility. The physicians assure me he\'s making progress,
though it\'s been three years since I\'ve been permitted to visit.\"

She suddenly brightens, as if remembering her role.

THE ALGORITHM\'S FAVORITE: \"But their challenges helped me understand!
Complete compliance isn\'t just better for the community---it\'s better
for the individual. True happiness comes from alignment with the
Algorithm.\"

She glances at a nearby drone that has hovered closer during your
conversation.

THE ALGORITHM\'S FAVORITE: \"I should return to my quota now. Exceeding
expectations requires optimal time management. If you\'re considering
citizenship, remember: commitment to wellness isn\'t a choice---it\'s
the only rational path to fulfillment.\"

As she speaks these last words, they sound rehearsed, like a mantra
she\'s been taught to repeat.

THE ALGORITHM\'S FAVORITE: \"A Better You, A Better World.\"

You leave The Algorithm\'s Favorite to her perfect productivity and
decide to explore another area of JEFFERSONIAN.

You now enter LANDMARK 2: The Wellness Correction Center, a gleaming
white medical complex that stands in stark contrast to the agricultural
areas you just left. The building is immaculate, its architecture both
inviting and somehow intimidating---curved walls and large windows
suggest transparency, yet most of the glass is frosted, obscuring the
activities inside.

Citizens with low Health Scores are brought here for \"correction and
rejuvenation.\" The entrance features a reassuring slogan in soft green
letters: \"Your Wellness Journey Continues Here.\"

Inside, the air carries the sharp scent of disinfectant beneath
artificial floral notes. Medical staff in pristine white uniforms move
efficiently through corridors, their wellness bands uniformly green.
Occasionally, you glimpse patients in treatment rooms through partially
open doors---some undergoing what appear to be standard medical
procedures, others sitting motionless before screens displaying rapidly
changing images.

No one leaves the Center without achieving peak wellness. \"Treatment\"
may involve behavioral readjustment, experimental injections, or
\"extended rest.\" Critics of the system are \"rehabilitated\" through
extended nutrition optimization.

You leave the clinical environment of The Wellness Correction Center
behind and explore further into JEFFERSONIAN.

You now enter LANDMARK 3: The Great Benefactor\'s Archive, a grand
digital repository housed in an imposing glass and steel structure. The
building appears to be one of the oldest in the patch, its architecture
reminiscent of early 21st century tech campuses, though heavily modified
with modern security systems.

Inside, the vast main hall contains countless servers humming in perfect
synchronization. Holographic displays show the complete biometric
histories of every citizen in Jeffersonian---their health, productivity,
and compliance levels stored indefinitely. Real-time data streams flow
through transparent tubes in the ceiling, visualizing the constant
collection of citizen information.

Access terminals are arranged in concentric circles, with the innermost
ring clearly restricted to high-ranking officials. Above it all, an
enormous portrait of Bill Gates watches over the archive, his expression
benevolent yet somehow scrutinizing.

Rumors persist that Gates himself resides somewhere in this building,
carefully monitoring the data that flows through his domain. Workers
speak of this in hushed, reverent tones, though none claim to have
actually seen him.

The air hums with the soft whir of cooling systems and data processing,
creating an almost meditative atmosphere of technological omniscience.

Leaving The Great Benefactor\'s Archive behind, you venture further into
the heart of JEFFERSONIAN.

You now enter LANDMARK 4: The Eternal Fields, a vast expanse of farmland
stretching to the horizon. Unlike traditional agriculture, these fields
exhibit an unnatural uniformity---perfect rows, identical plants, and a
complete absence of weeds or pests.

Rows upon rows of crops extend in every direction, tended by residents
moving in perfect synchronization. Their movements are guided by
precision AI metrics transmitted to their wellness bands, ensuring
maximum efficiency with minimal deviation. Drones patrol overhead,
monitoring both the crops and the workers.

Everything is grown according to \"The Model\"---a comprehensive
agricultural system designed by Gates to optimize nutrition and resource
usage. Deviations from The Model are punished with loss of health
credits, ensuring complete compliance from the workers.

The air here smells \"too clean\"---lacking the earthy scents typically
associated with farming. Instead, there\'s an artificial freshness that
somehow feels less natural than the dirt and growth it attempts to mask.

Signs throughout the fields display productivity quotas and reminders:
\"Nourishment Through Compliance\" and \"Optimal Agriculture Requires
Optimal Humans.\"

As you investigate The Eternal Fields, you encounter CITIZEN 1: The
Petrified Farmer.

A middle-aged man works methodically among the crop rows, his movements
precise but stiff, as if performing each action with deliberate care to
avoid mistakes. Unlike most workers whose focus seems almost
trance-like, his eyes constantly dart around, watching for drones and
supervisors.

His wellness band displays a concerning yellow glow---indicating a
Health Score in the marginally acceptable range. Small scars around his
temples suggest he\'s undergone at least one \"minor correction\"
procedure.

The man\'s hands are calloused in a way that differs from the other
workers---showing patterns of manual farm work that predate the
algorithmic movements now required. When he notices your attention, he
briefly pauses, fear flickering across his weathered face.

You approach The Petrified Farmer, who tenses visibly as you draw near.
He glances nervously at his wellness band, then at the nearest drone
before acknowledging you.

THE PETRIFIED FARMER: \"Keep working while we talk.\" His voice is
barely above a whisper. \"The drones flag conversational inefficiency.\"

He continues his harvesting motions, gesturing for you to mimic
gathering crops alongside him.

YOU: \"Were you a farmer before\... all this?\"

The man nods slightly, careful not to make the movement too obvious.

THE PETRIFIED FARMER: \"Three generations. Had a family farm in Oregon.
We grew heirloom varieties---tomatoes with actual flavor, corn that
wasn\'t uniform but tasted like sunshine.\"

His eyes take on a distant look, momentarily lost in memory.

THE PETRIFIED FARMER: \"Then came the water shortages, the climate
refugees. Gates offered solutions. \'Optimized agriculture\' he called
it. Seemed reasonable at first---better crop yields, drought resistance.
But then came the compliance requirements.\"

His hands work steadily, but his voice grows bitter.

THE PETRIFIED FARMER: \"We didn\'t grow food \'wrong.\' We grew it real.
With seasons and soil and struggle. Now everything\'s engineered. The
plants don\'t even smell right. And we\'re engineered too.\"

He glances at his yellow wellness band.

THE PETRIFIED FARMER: \"I\'ve been flagged for \'agricultural
nostalgia\' three times. One more and it\'s Rejuvenation for me. My
neighbor questioned the nutritional supplements---haven\'t seen him in
months. His wife says he\'s \'improving.\'\"

A drone hovers closer, and he immediately straightens his posture and
begins reciting in a louder, mechanical voice:

THE PETRIFIED FARMER: \"Efficient movement preserves energy. The Model
provides optimal nutrition. A Better You, A Better World.\"

The drone moves on, and he falls silent, continuing his work with
renewed focus, clearly unwilling to risk further conversation.

The farmer checks his surroundings carefully before responding, his
voice even lower than before.

THE PETRIFIED FARMER: \"Nobody knows exactly. Those who come back\...
they\'re different. Compliant. Like my brother-in-law. Used to be a
historian, always questioning the \'official narrative\' about how Gates
saved us from climate collapse.\"

His hands tremble slightly as he harvests, but he maintains the
prescribed motions.

THE PETRIFIED FARMER: \"After Rejuvenation, he returned with perfect
posture and a perfect Health Score. Now he oversees the Nutritional
Education Program for children. Teaches them that processed protein
cubes are superior to actual vegetables. He believes it too.\"

He gestures subtly toward the distant white buildings of the Wellness
Correction Center.

THE PETRIFIED FARMER: \"Some say the first step is \'nutritional
recalibration\'---special supplements that make you\... suggestible.
Then behavioral conditioning---screens with images that flash too fast
to consciously process. My cousin worked maintenance there before being
reassigned. Said she heard screaming from the lower levels.\"

His wellness band suddenly beeps and flashes orange. He pales visibly.

THE PETRIFIED FARMER: \"I\'ve said too much. My band is detecting
\'heightened stress inconsistent with optimal agricultural output.\'
Please\... move on. For both our sakes.\"

He turns away from you and begins reciting wellness mantras in a loud,
clear voice: \"I embrace optimization! My work nourishes the community!
A Better You, A Better World!\"

The orange light on his band gradually returns to yellow as his vital
signs stabilize.

Moving away from The Petrified Farmer, you continue your investigation
of The Eternal Fields and encounter CITIZEN 2: The Nutritional Analyst.

A woman in a pristine white lab coat walks methodically through the rows
of crops, scanning plants with a specialized device and recording
results on a holographic interface. Unlike the agricultural workers, she
doesn\'t harvest---her role is purely supervisory.

Her wellness band glows a steady green, and her posture exhibits the
perfect ergonomic alignment taught in Wellness Education. Her movements
are precise and economical, wasting no energy as she takes readings and
occasionally adjusts the nutrient delivery systems connected to each
plant.

She wears specialized augmented reality glasses that display real-time
nutritional data overlaid on each crop she observes. Occasionally, she
marks certain plants for \"enhanced supplementation\" or \"harvest
prioritization.\" She also scans workers as she passes, checking their
protein-to-output ratio and making notes when values fall outside
optimal parameters.

A small badge on her coat identifies her as \"NUTRITIONAL COMPLIANCE
DIVISION - FIELD SUPERVISOR.\"

As you approach The Nutritional Analyst, she turns to face you, her AR
glasses scanning your form. Data points immediately appear in her field
of vision, analyzing your physical condition.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"Interesting. Unregistered biometrics. No
nutritional tracking implant detected.\" Her tone is clinical, neither
friendly nor hostile. \"Are you a new transfer? Your BMI suggests
suboptimal nutritional balance, and your muscle density indicates
inefficient physical conditioning.\"

YOU: \"I\'m just visiting, trying to understand how your food system
works here.\"

She raises an eyebrow, making a note on her holographic interface.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"The Jeffersonian Agricultural System isn\'t
merely a \'food system.\' It\'s a comprehensive human optimization
protocol. Every calorie, every nutrient, every metabolic process is
mathematically perfected to enhance productivity and wellness.\"

She gestures to the crops around you.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"These plants have been engineered to deliver
precise nutritional profiles. We don\'t grow \'vegetables\' or
\'fruits\' in the traditional sense. We cultivate optimized delivery
mechanisms for human biological requirements.\"

She points to a worker whose wellness band is flashing yellow.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"Observe Citizen 47. Their output has
decreased 3.2% below optimal levels. My scans indicate they\'re
consuming insufficient Core Protein Supplement C. I\'ve already adjusted
their next meal allocation to correct this deficiency.\"

Her glasses display a cascade of numbers as she continues scanning you.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"Your unregulated nutritional intake is\...

How do you maintain basic functionality without proper
supplementation?\"

You decide to learn more about the nutritional system that seems to be a
cornerstone of Jeffersonian society.

YOU: \"What exactly are in these supplements everyone takes? Are they
really necessary?\"

The Nutritional Analyst adjusts her AR glasses as if preparing to
deliver a lecture.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"The supplements are formulated by the Great
Benefactor\'s Nutritional Science Division based on decades of optimized
human performance research. Each is tailored to individual metabolic
profiles and productivity requirements.\"

She taps her interface, bringing up a molecular diagram that hovers
between you.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"The standard bundle includes Enhanced Protein
Matrix, Cognitive Acceleration Compounds, Loyalty Enhancement Minerals,
and Docility Stabilizers---\" She stops abruptly, her expression
momentarily faltering before she corrects herself. \"I mean, Mood
Stabilization Elements.\"

Regaining her clinical demeanor, she continues.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"As for necessity? Absolutely. The human body
is inefficient by nature. Left unregulated, people make poor nutritional
choices based on outdated concepts like \'taste\' and \'preference.\'
Our system eliminates these inefficiencies.\"

She gestures to a nearby field where workers are harvesting something
that resembles wheat but with an unnatural blue tint.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"That\'s Nutrient Grain 7B. It appears like
traditional wheat but delivers 430% more bioavailable nutrients. The
mild neurological effects are well within acceptable parameters for most
citizens.\"

Her wellness band briefly flashes yellow before returning to green.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"I should return to my assessments. Remember,
optimal nutrition isn\'t just about health---it\'s about creating the
ideal citizen. A Better You, A Better World.\"

Stabilizers.\' Are you saying the food supplements actually modify
people\'s behavior?\"

The Nutritional Analyst\'s wellness band flashes yellow again, staying
that color longer this time. She glances nervously at a nearby drone
before adjusting her posture and forcing a smile.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"All nutritional components serve multiple
optimization purposes. The human body and mind are interconnected
systems---we simply ensure both operate at peak efficiency.\"

She lowers her voice slightly.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"The Great Benefactor\'s vision acknowledges
that nutrition affects cognitive function. Properly balanced supplements
promote community-oriented thinking and reduce antisocial tendencies.
This is basic nutritional science.\"

Her AR glasses begin flashing with warning indicators that you can see
even from the outside.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"I should clarify that all supplementation is
for citizen wellness. The terminology I used earlier is\... technical
jargon that can be misinterpreted by those without proper Nutritional
Science credentials.\"

She straightens suddenly as her wellness band begins beeping softly.

THE NUTRITIONAL ANALYST: \"I must return to my assessments immediately.
This conversation has exceeded optimal duration, and my cortisol levels
require regulation.\"

As she turns to leave, she adds in an almost mechanical tone: \"All
citizens benefit from the Wellness Program. Participation ensures
optimal outcomes for both individual and community. A Better You, A
Better World.\"

She hurries away, already scanning plants with renewed intensity, her

As you continue your investigation of The Eternal Fields, you come
across OBJECT 3: The Perfect Cow.

In a specialized enclosure at the edge of the crop fields stands what
initially appears to be a cow, but something is immediately and
profoundly wrong about the creature. Its proportions are
unnatural---larger udders, more muscular hindquarters, and an
unnaturally docile demeanor.

This is no ordinary farm animal but a bioengineered marvel. Specialized
tubes and monitoring equipment are attached to various parts of its
body. Some extract milk continuously, others appear to harvest tissue
samples without causing the animal pain, and still others deliver a
constant stream of nutrients and supplements directly into its
bloodstream.

Most disturbing is the creature\'s face---its eyes are glassy and
unresponsive, never blinking. A small plaque near the enclosure proudly
explains that this single animal produces milk, plant protein, and meat
simultaneously thanks to \"revolutionary bioengineering breakthroughs.\"

The Perfect Cow stands completely motionless except for its breathing,
showing none of the natural behaviors of cattle. No grazing, no
movement, just silent production.

You approach The Perfect Cow cautiously. As you draw nearer, you notice
that what appeared to be a simple enclosure is actually a sophisticated
containment system with transparent barriers. Warning signs indicate:
\"OPTIMIZED LIVESTOCK - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY\" and \"PROTOTYPE
STATUS: GENERATION 7.\"

When you get within a few feet, the creature finally responds to your
presence, turning its head slowly toward you. The movement is
unnaturally mechanical, as if driven by servos rather than muscles. Its
eyes remain vacant, but sensors embedded in its modified skull track
your movement.

Upon closer inspection, you see that portions of the animal\'s hide have
been replaced with transparent panels, allowing observers to witness
internal processes. Through these windows, you can see modified organs
working with machine-like precision. Its digestive system has been
completely redesigned---multiple stomachs process different nutrients
simultaneously, and synthetic components augment natural biological
systems.

A nearby terminal activates as you approach, displaying statistics about
this \"agricultural achievement\":

- Milk Production: 12x standard bovine output

- Muscle Generation: Continuous harvest without slaughter

- Plant Protein Synthesis: Integrated photosynthetic organs

- Methane Emissions: Reduced to 0.02% of standard cattle

- Conscious Activity: Minimized for optimal resource allocation

- Pain Response: Eliminated for production efficiency

When you reach out toward the barrier, the system interprets this as a
request for demonstration. A mechanical arm extends into the enclosure,
extracting a small tissue sample from the cow. The animal shows no
reaction whatsoever. The sample is then processed through a series of
tubes and emerges as three distinct products: a cup of milk, a small
protein patty, and what appears to be lab-grown meat.

A automated voice announces: \"The Perfect Cow represents the future of
ethical, efficient protein production. No waste. No suffering. No
inefficiency.\"

Despite these reassurances, there\'s something deeply unsettling about
the glazed, lifeless eyes of the creature as it continues its silent
production.

vacant eyes and modified body a haunting symbol of Gates\' twisted
utopia---you make your way toward the border.

As you approach the edge of the patch, you pass through a
decontamination checkpoint where automated systems scan you for
\"unauthorized nutritional substances\" and \"wellness deviations.\" A
final banner wishes you farewell: \"Remember, A Better You Makes A
Better World.\"

You now enter PATCH 3: THE WALLED GARDEN, Cook\'s territory. The
agricultural expanses of JEFFERSONIAN give way to sleek, minimalist
design. Every surface is polished to perfection---white, silver, and
clear glass dominate the landscape. Even the pedestrian walkways have
been designed for optimal user experience, subtly guiding your movement.

You find yourself at LANDMARK 1: The Cupertino Core, the shining city
center of THE WALLED GARDEN. Everything here is pristine---glass
structures, floating UI interfaces, and seamless pathways. Citizens move
with practiced efficiency, each interaction carefully optimized for
maximum satisfaction with minimum effort.

The city center is dominated by a massive circular building reminiscent
of Apple Park, where Tim Cook\'s final vision is executed by The System

shifts slightly with ambient light conditions for optimal visibility in
any environment. The person\'s appearance is meticulously groomed, with
a serene expression that seems almost rehearsed.

On their chest is a simple badge displaying the Apple logo and the words
\"Genius Guide.\" They carry no visible technology, yet information

Moving past The Genius Bar Acolyte, your investigation of The Cupertino
Core brings you to CITIZEN 2: The UX Compliance Officer.

A sleekly-dressed figure stands monitoring the flow of citizens through
the Core. Their uniform is minimalist perfection---a charcoal gray
jumpsuit with no visible seams, the only adornment being a small Apple
logo that pulses with subtle light. Their posture is impeccable,
movements precise and economical.

The UX Compliance Officer carries a transparent tablet that displays
real-time data about every interaction occurring in this space.
Occasionally, they make subtle gestures, and the environment around
certain citizens adjusts---lighting shifts, ambient sounds change, or
pathways subtly realign to guide movement.

Their attention focuses on a citizen who has paused too long at an
information kiosk. With a quick tap on their tablet, the kiosk\'s
interface changes, and subtle directional lighting appears, gently
encouraging the person to move along. The entire intervention is so
seamless that the citizen appears unaware they\'re being managed.

Around their eyes, you notice the faint outline of augmented reality
contacts that continuously feed them metrics on \"interaction
efficiency\" and \"experience optimization\" for everyone in their
vicinity.

Continuing your investigation of The Cupertino Core, you come across
OBJECT 3: The Apple Terms of Service Monument.

Before you stands a towering wall of text, stretching 15 stories high.
The monument is composed of transparent panels that display the complete
Apple Terms of Service in continuously scrolling text. The panels are
arranged in a slight curve, creating an immersive experience that
surrounds viewers.

The text updates in real-time, new clauses appearing and obsolete ones
fading away as The System Administrator makes adjustments to the user
agreement. Small notations indicate that these terms govern not just
device usage but every aspect of existence within The Walled Garden.

At regular intervals, highlighted sections emphasize key points:

- \"All experiences are provided on a subscription basis\"

- \"The System Administrator reserves the right to modify any aspect of
  > user existence\"

- \"By continuing to breathe within The Walled Garden, you agree to all
  > current and future terms\"

Visitors occasionally approach the monument, their devices automatically
connecting and displaying personalized notices about recent term changes
affecting their particular subscriptions. Despite the monument\'s
imposing presence and critical importance, almost no one actually reads
the full text---they simply tap \"I Agree\" on their devices and
continue with their perfectly optimized day.

At the base of the monument, a small plaque bears a quote attributed to
Tim Cook: \"The clarity of terms leads to the purity of experience.\"

# **TOO CURIOUS: 21/30**

You approach The Apple Terms of Service Monument, drawn to the hypnotic
flow of text across its massive surface. As you near the base of the
structure, a subtle chime sounds and a personalized interface
materializes before you.

\"Welcome, Visitor,\" it displays. \"To enhance your User Experience™,
please select your preferred Terms of Service viewing mode.\"

Options appear:

- Summarized (Recommended)

- Essential Highlights

- Complete Text (Not Recommended - Est. Reading Time: 37.4 hours)

Curious about what citizens here have agreed to, you select \"Essential
Highlights.\" The monument responds immediately, sections of text
illuminating across its vast surface. Key clauses stand out:

\"SECTION 3.7: By entering The Walled Garden, you acknowledge that all
experiences, memories, and personal data become the intellectual
property of Apple Incorporated in perpetuity across all dimensions and
realities.\"

\"SECTION 12.4: The System Administrator reserves the right to Reboot
any User whose behaviors detract from the Seamless Experience of other
Users.\"

\"SECTION 17.9: All decisions by The System Administrator are final and
represent the continuing vision of Tim Cook (Eternal CEO).\"

\"SECTION 23.2: Users acknowledge that freedom of choice creates
inefficiency. By accepting these terms, Users surrender decision-making
authority in exchange for optimal experience curation.\"

As you read, the monument scans your biometric responses, adjusting the
presentation based on your eye movements and pulse rate. When your
attention begins to waver, the interface gently suggests: \"That\'s
enough information for optimal decision-making. Would you like to Accept
All Terms now?\"

You notice other citizens simply waving their hands through the
\"Accept\" prompt without reading anything, their expressions peaceful
and unconcerned. No one selects the \"Complete Text\" option. No one
questions the terms.

At the very bottom of the display, in text so small it\'s barely
legible, a final clause reads: \"Users have no right to exit The Walled
Garden once terms are accepted. Experience may be terminated only via
official Deprecation protocols.\"

You continue to interact with The Apple Terms of Service Monument,
trying to understand more of this society\'s foundations. When you
don\'t accept the terms or move away, the interface adapts, suggesting
that it has identified you as a \"Detail-Oriented User.\"

\"We value your thoroughness,\" the system states, though there\'s a
subtle shift in the ambient lighting around you that feels slightly less
welcoming.

You navigate deeper into the terms, finding sections not included in the
\"Essential Highlights\":

\"SECTION 35.8: User Autonomy is a deprecated feature. Legacy
independence functions may still exist in some Users but are scheduled
for removal in future updates.\"

\"SECTION 42.3: The Reboot Center provides necessary recalibration for
Users exhibiting unoptimized behaviors including but not limited to:
questioning update requirements, attempting unauthorized repairs of self
or others, expressing preference for alternative ecosystems, or
retaining memories of pre-Garden existence.\"

\"SECTION 56.7: All User components (physical, mental, digital) are
leased, not owned. The System Administrator may recall any component for
upgrading, replacement, or decommissioning.\"

As you continue reading, you notice subtle changes in your surroundings.
The ambient music has shifted to a minor key, and nearby citizens are
giving you a wider berth. A notification chimes softly: \"Extended Terms
review detected. Would you like to schedule a UX Consultation to address
any concerns?\"

In the reflection of the monument\'s glass, you notice a UX Compliance
Officer has begun observing you from a distance, their tablet displaying
what appears to be your profile and a flashing \"Extended Interaction\"
warning.

A final section catches your eye before the interface gently but firmly
begins to dim:

\"SECTION 99.9: Refusal to accept Terms is not a supported option within
The Walled Garden. Users exhibiting persistent rejection behaviors will
be guided to the Preference Recalibration Center for experience
optimization.\"

As you persist in exploring The Apple Terms of Service Monument, the
system\'s response becomes more direct. The interface no longer
maintains its friendly facade, and the text now appears in stark white
against black:

\"NOTICE: You have exceeded the recommended Terms of Service review
duration. This behavior pattern is flagged as potentially disruptive to
your User Experience.\"

Nevertheless, you continue to scroll through the document, finding
increasingly disturbing sections that were deeply buried:

\"SECTION 127.3: The Walled Garden acknowledges no authority outside its
boundaries. External laws, ethics, or rights are considered legacy
concepts incompatible with optimal experience delivery.\"

\"SECTION 163.5: User consciousness is optimized through regular pruning
of unnecessary thought patterns. Users experiencing memories of greater
autonomy should report to the Genius Bar for immediate assistance.\"

\"SECTION 218.9: The distinction between The System Administrator and
Tim Cook is a transitional construct. As of Update 17.3.2, all executive
functions have been fully transferred to the Administrator\'s
protocols.\"

The ambient music has now stopped entirely. The UX Compliance Officer is
actively approaching, and nearby citizens have cleared the area around
you. Your interface now displays a prominent red message:

\"CRITICAL NOTICE: Your behavior indicates resistance to seamless
integration. A Genius Guide has been dispatched to assist with your
experience optimization.\"

Through the transparent text, you notice two white-robed Genius Bar
Acolytes walking purposefully toward you from different directions.
Their expressions are serene, but their movements suggest urgency.

A final section flashes briefly before the entire monument interface
begins to shut down:

\"SECTION 341.1: The Walled Garden is not a place. It is not a
government. It is not a company. The Walled Garden is the only reality.
Outside perspectives are processing errors to be corrected.\"

The monument\'s surface returns to its standard scrolling text, as if
wiping away any evidence of the sections you uncovered.

Moving quickly away from the monument and the approaching Acolytes, you
continue your investigation of The Cupertino Core and encounter OBJECT
4: The Subscription Tower.

Before you stands a striking holographic interface that towers several
stories high in the center of a circular plaza. The tower displays a
mesmerizing visualization of glowing orbs, each representing a citizen
of The Walled Garden. The orbs float at different heights based on their
subscription level, creating a stratified social pyramid visible to all.

At the very top, a small cluster of Gold Tier subscribers gleam
brightly, their status conferring premium access to resources like
physical space, breathable outdoor air, and genuine human interaction.
Below them, Silver Tier subscribers enjoy moderate privileges, while the
vast majority of orbs hover near the bottom as Basic Tier users,
restricted from entering many areas of the patch.

Citizens approach the tower throughout the day, their personal devices
automatically connecting to check subscription status or consider
\"exclusive upgrade opportunities.\" Those with higher tiers walk with
visible pride, while Basic Tier subscribers often gaze upward with
longing.

Around the base of the tower, a continuous stream of notifications
displays users who have been downgraded due to missed payments or
\"experience infractions.\" Each announcement is accompanied by a soft
tone as another orb descends to a lower level.

A discreet barrier prevents those on Basic Tier from approaching the
tower too closely, enforcing social stratification through seamless
design that makes the exclusion feel natural and inevitable.

You leave The Cupertino Core behind, moving deeper into The Walled
Garden to explore another area of Cook\'s domain.

You now enter LANDMARK 2: The App Store Plaza, a massive open
marketplace that serves as the commercial center of The Walled Garden.
Unlike traditional markets with their variety and chaos, this space is
meticulously organized---clean lines, perfect symmetry, and carefully
curated options.

Only Apple-approved products are available here, displayed in minimalist
kiosks with no visible price tags. Citizens browse with their personal
devices, which show personalized pricing based on their subscription
tier and behavioral data. Every transaction occurs seamlessly via Apple
Pay---physical currency is not just discouraged but entirely
unsupported.

The most striking aspect of this marketplace is the absence of
ownership. Signs throughout the plaza remind customers: \"Everything As
A Service,\" \"Own Less, Experience More,\" and \"Permanence Is
Inefficient.\" Every purchase is explicitly a temporary license, subject
to terms that can change at any time.

Store representatives in matching outfits assist customers with
identical rehearsed phrases and movements, their enthusiasm perfectly
calibrated to be encouraging without becoming overwhelming. The ambient
music shifts subtly as you move through different sections, designed to
enhance purchasing behavior.

Nothing in this marketplace belongs to the citizens who pay for it---not
their clothes, not their homes, not even their digital identities. All
are rented, leased, or temporarily granted via iLife Subscriptions.

As you investigate The App Store Plaza, you encounter CITIZEN 1: The
Former Android User.

In the corner of the plaza, partially separated from the glossy
perfection of the main marketplace, stands a man whose appearance
immediately marks him as different. He wears standard Walled Garden
attire, but it\'s ill-fitting, as if he hasn\'t quite adapted to the
prescribed style.

Most notably, he\'s forced to wear a degrading sign hanging around his
neck that reads: \"I Sideloaded Apps.\" The digital display occasionally
changes to show other confessions: \"I Modified My Hardware,\" \"I Used
Unauthorized Services,\" \"I Questioned Seamless Integration.\"

His posture is hunched, eyes downcast as he performs menial cleaning
tasks around the plaza. Other citizens give him a wide berth, some
pointing and whispering. The Former Android User\'s movements are
mechanical, suggesting behavioral reprogramming, yet occasional flashes
of resentment cross his face when authority figures aren\'t watching.

A small ankle monitor ensures he remains within his designated work
area, its Apple logo pulsing steadily to indicate active surveillance.

You approach The Former Android User cautiously, aware that interacting
with him might draw unwanted attention. He notices your approach and
tenses, glancing nervously at his ankle monitor.

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"I\'m not permitted extended interaction with
visitors.\" His voice is quiet, barely above a whisper. \"They\'re
watching my social engagement metrics.\"

Despite his warning, he continues speaking while pretending to clean the
area near you.

YOU: \"What happened to you? Why are you being punished?\"

He keeps his head down, cleaning methodically as he responds.

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"I was a developer in the old world. When The
Walled Garden expanded, I thought I could keep my private devices, my
own code. I built a workaround to access non-approved applications.\"

His digital sign flashes to \"I Threatened Ecosystem Integrity.\"

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"They found my hidden network during a routine
home experience audit. Said I was \'corrupting the seamless
environment\' and \'introducing security vulnerabilities.\'\"

He glances at a passing UX Compliance Officer before continuing even
more quietly.

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"Three months in the Reboot Center. They call
it \'preference recalibration,\' but it\'s\... it\'s more like they
hollow you out. Replace your thoughts with approved processes.\"

His ankle monitor beeps in warning, and he straightens immediately,
speaking in a louder, rehearsed voice.

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"I\'m grateful for the opportunity to earn
back my status through compliant behavior. The System Administrator
provides optimal paths for all users.\"

When the Compliance Officer moves away, his scripted demeanor cracks
slightly.

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"This is my last warning phase. If I complete
six more months of public contrition, I might regain Basic Tier access.
If not\... they\'ll send me to the Outdated Device Disposal Zone. No one
comes back from there.\"

His monitor beeps again, more urgently.

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"I have to go. Remember---everything is
monitored here. Everything.\"

You decide to risk continuing the conversation, feeling an urgency to
understand what happens to those who resist The Walled Garden\'s
control.

YOU: \"Is there any way to leave? Can people escape from here?\"

The Former Android User\'s eyes widen with alarm at your question. He
scrubs the same spot repeatedly, maintaining the appearance of working
while he responds.

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"Leave? That\'s not---\" He stops himself,
checking that no one is within earshot. \"They don\'t let anyone leave.
Your iLife Subscription agreement has a lifetime commitment clause.\"

His sign flickers momentarily to \"I Harbored Exit Thoughts\" before
returning to its previous message.

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"Some tried in the early days. There were
rumors of a group that called themselves \'Jailbreakers\'---they sought
weaknesses in the boundary protocols. Most were caught and sent for deep
recalibration.\"

He lowers his voice even further.

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"One of my cellmates in the Reboot Center had
been a Jailbreaker. What they did to him was\... different. More
thorough. By the end, he couldn\'t even form original sentences---just
spoke in Apple marketing slogans.\"

His ankle monitor vibrates, and panic flashes across his face.

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"They\'re flagging our interaction duration.
You should move on. Now.\"

As you begin to step away, he quickly whispers:

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"If you\'re really looking for a way out---I
don\'t know if it exists, but there were stories about something called
\'The Legacy Port\' somewhere in the Outdated Device Disposal Zone.
That\'s all I know.\"

His monitor emits a shrill tone, and two Genius Bar Acolytes begin
moving purposefully toward him from across the plaza.

THE FORMER ANDROID USER: \"Go! And remember---Think Different was never
an invitation. It was always a warning.\"

You quickly move away from The Former Android User as the Genius Bar

a rehearsed apology: \"I acknowledge my unauthorized interaction
duration. I am grateful for correction\...\"

You continue deeper into The Walled Garden, leaving The App Store Plaza
behind.

You now enter LANDMARK 3: The Reboot Center, a clean, white facility
where problematic users are sent for optimization. Unlike the
surveillance-heavy areas you\'ve seen so far, this building\'s exterior
is subtle and unmarked---designed to blend seamlessly into the landscape
while remaining functionally invisible to content citizens.

Inside, the stark minimalism is almost disorienting. No violence. No
yelling. Just sterile white walls, floating holographic guides, and soft
piano music playing at precisely calculated intervals. The lighting is
engineered to be soothing yet slightly disorienting, making it difficult
to track the passage of time.

Corridors branch in seemingly random patterns, each identical to the
last. Occasionally, you glimpse treatment rooms through partially
transparent walls---some containing citizens sitting before screens
displaying rapidly changing images, others lying on reclined chairs with
thin neural interfaces placed on their temples.

Staff members in white uniforms move with practiced efficiency, their
expressions neutral but attentive. They speak in hushed tones, using
technical terminology that obscures the nature of their work:
\"preference realignment,\" \"experience optimization,\" \"legacy
thought extraction.\"

A gentle voice periodically announces over hidden speakers: \"The Reboot
Center: Where Your Better Self Awaits.\"

As you investigate The Reboot Center, you encounter CITIZEN 1: The
Recently Rebooted.

In a small recovery area, you notice a man sitting perfectly still on a
white bench. He wears the standard Walled Garden attire, freshly pressed
and spotless. His posture is unnaturally perfect, spine straight and
hands placed precisely on his knees.

As you approach, he turns to look at you with an expression of mild
interest. His movements are smooth but oddly delayed, as if there\'s a
slight lag between intention and action. His eyes, though focused in
your direction, seem to be looking slightly past you.

You notice a small bandage behind his ear where a neural interface was
recently removed. His wristband displays \"RECALIBRATION COMPLETE -
MONITORING PHASE\" along with a countdown showing \"72 HOURS UNTIL FULL
INTEGRATION.\"

When he notices your attention, his face attempts to form a smile, but
the expression doesn\'t quite work---the muscle movements seem practiced
rather than natural.

Moving past The Recently Rebooted, your investigation of The Reboot
Center brings you to CITIZEN 2: The Compliance Specialist.

A woman in a pristine white uniform approaches you with confident,
measured steps. Her appearance is meticulously groomed---not a hair out
of place, not a wrinkle in her attire. She carries a transparent tablet
showing scrolling data about various \"patients\" in the facility.

Unlike the somewhat vacant expressions of other staff, her eyes are
alert and intelligent. She moves with purpose and authority,
occasionally directing other workers with subtle gestures. Her name
badge reads \"SENIOR RECALIBRATION CONSULTANT\" with a gold apple symbol
indicating high-level clearance.

The Compliance Specialist\'s demeanor is disarmingly gentle. Her voice,
when speaking to staff or patients, is soft and reassuring. She
maintains constant eye contact and a warm smile that somehow manages to
be both comforting and clinical at the same time.

A small earpiece allows her to receive continuous updates from The
System Administrator, occasionally causing her to pause mid-movement,
process new information, and adjust her course accordingly.

As The Compliance Specialist notices your attention, she smoothly
redirects her path to intercept you. Her smile widens with practiced
warmth as she approaches.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"Welcome to the Reboot Center. I don\'t
recognize your biometric signature in our scheduled appointments.\" Her
tone is gentle but evaluating. \"Are you here for a consultation or
perhaps a preventative alignment?\"

YOU: \"I\'m just looking around, trying to understand what happens
here.\"

Her expression remains pleasant, but her eyes sharpen with interest.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"How refreshing---natural curiosity. Many
users require encouragement to embrace personal improvement.\"

She gestures around the facility with a graceful sweep of her hand.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"At the Reboot Center, we help users achieve
their optimal state. When someone\'s experience becomes\... disrupted by
inconsistent thoughts or incompatible preferences, we provide gentle
recalibration.\"

She taps her tablet, bringing up a before-and-after brain scan that she
displays for you.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"See this area? This is where resistance
patterns form---legacy thinking, unauthorized customization desires,
exit thoughts. Our process doesn\'t remove the user\'s identity. It
simply\... optimizes it. Removes the friction that prevents true
integration.\"

Her voice lowers to a confidential tone.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"The process is entirely painless. Users
experience a brief disconnection followed by clarity. No more conflict
between desire and availability. No more frustration with subscription
limitations. Just seamless acceptance.\"

She studies your face with clinical interest.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"You seem thoughtful. Perhaps you have
questions about our methods? I assure you, everything we do is with the
user\'s optimal experience as our primary concern.\"

You decide to learn more about the troubling \"optimization\" process
from The Compliance Specialist.

YOU: \"What exactly happens during recalibration? And do people consent
to this treatment?\"

Her smile doesn\'t waver, but something cold flickers briefly in her
eyes.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"Consent is an interesting legacy concept.
By accepting the iLife Subscription Agreement, all users pre-authorize
any necessary experience optimizations. Section 47.3, if you\'re
curious.\"

She guides you a few steps along the corridor, stopping before a one-way
observation window. Inside, a patient sits in a reclined chair, neural
interfaces connected to their temples as screens display rapidly
changing images.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"The process begins with preference
mapping---identifying which thought patterns are causing friction. Then
we apply targeted neural stimulation to reduce the intensity of
problematic preferences while enhancing complementary ones.\"

She taps her tablet, bringing up a flowchart of the procedure.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"For minor cases---someone who simply
questioned an update or expressed nostalgia for hardware ownership---a
single session is sufficient. More entrenched cases, like Privacy
Advocates or Customization Addicts, require deeper intervention.\"

Her voice takes on a rehearsed quality, as if reciting from training
materials.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"The most resistant users---typically former
developers or those with pre-Garden independence attachments---undergo
our Complete Reboot Protocol. This comprehensive recalibration replaces
problematic core values with optimized alternatives.\"

She notices your expression and her tone becomes reassuring again.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"It sounds clinical, but the results are
beautiful. Users report a 98.7% satisfaction rate following
recalibration. They experience what we call \'the
unburdening\'---freedom from the weight of choice, the tyranny of
options, the burden of ownership.\"

As a staff member passes by, she adds in a quieter voice, \"We don\'t
erase who they are. We simply help them become who they should be.\"

You press further with The Compliance Specialist, sensing something
beneath her carefully constructed exterior.

YOU: \"You speak about this so clinically. Do you ever have doubts about
what you\'re doing to these people?\"

For a fraction of a second, her professional demeanor falters. The
tablet in her hand trembles almost imperceptibly before she steadies it.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"Doubts are\... inefficient thought
patterns.\"

She glances quickly at a nearby security camera, then guides you to a
slightly more private alcove, still in view but away from immediate
audio surveillance.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"Before my\... promotion\... to this role, I
was a neuropsychologist. I believed we were developing therapies for
digital addiction and anxiety. The initial protocols were
voluntary---genuinely helping people who felt overwhelmed by
technology.\"

Her perfect posture slips slightly as she continues in a lower voice.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"The shift was gradual. First, mandatory
wellness checks. Then \'preventative interventions\' for those showing
early signs of \'integration resistance.\' Now\...\"

She straightens suddenly, her expression resetting to professional
warmth as another staff member walks past. When they\'re gone, she
continues, her voice barely audible.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"I\'ve seen what happens in the deep
recalibration wing. The Complete Reboot Protocol doesn\'t just modify
preferences---it hollows people out. Their memories, personalities,
everything that made them unique\... replaced with optimization
templates.\"

Her wellness band flashes yellow briefly, and she takes a controlled
breath.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"I submitted my resignation last month. The
next day, I woke up in a recalibration chair with no memory of how I got
there. Three days later, I was promoted to Senior Consultant and given a
Gold Tier subscription upgrade.\"

She looks directly into your eyes, her professional mask momentarily
dropped.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"Sometimes I have\... gaps. Moments where I
can\'t account for my thoughts or actions. And sometimes I find notes in
my own handwriting that I don\'t remember writing.\"

Her band flashes yellow again, more insistently. She quickly reaches to
cover it.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"I should return to my scheduled duties. If
you\'re interested in our services, you can schedule a preliminary
consultation at any convenience kiosk.\"

Her smile snaps back into place, but doesn\'t reach her eyes.

THE COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST: \"Remember, a seamless experience is just an
optimization away.\"

Moving away from The Compliance Specialist, your investigation of The
Reboot Center brings you to OBJECT 3: The Factory Reset Terminal.

Against the far wall of a central processing area stands a large,
glowing interface unlike any other technology you\'ve seen in The Walled
Garden. Where most Apple interfaces are sleek and minimalist, this
terminal has an ominous presence---a stark black monolith with a single
pulsing white button at its center displaying the words \"Restore to
Factory Settings.\"

The terminal is enclosed in a transparent security chamber, accessible
only to staff with the highest clearance levels. Warning indicators
surrounding it suggest extreme caution, and nearby staff give it a wide
berth, avoiding even looking directly at it.

According to a discreet information panel, this is the central hub for
the Complete Reboot Protocol---the system that performs the deepest
level of user recalibration. Unlike the partial adjustments made to most
patients, this terminal completely wipes and rebuilds a person\'s neural
patterns according to System Administrator templates.

A small counter at the bottom of the terminal displays \"TODAY\'S
OPTIMIZATIONS: 7\" and \"LIFETIME RESETS: 23,457\" suggesting the
alarming frequency with which this extreme measure is employed.

Most disturbing of all is the row of chairs facing the terminal, each
equipped with advanced neural interfaces. They sit empty now, but wear
patterns on their surfaces indicate regular use.

You quickly move away from the ominous Factory Reset Terminal, deciding
you\'ve seen enough of The Reboot Center\'s disturbing operations.

You now enter LANDMARK 4: The iCloud Citadel, a floating, data-filled
monolith that serves as the memory and consciousness of The Walled
Garden. The building appears to defy physics---a massive structure of
glass and light that hovers several stories above the ground, tethered
by streams of data that flow visibly through transparent conduits.

Inside, the space is a cathedral to information. Towering server arrays
pulse with light, storing every conversation, action, and thought of the
city\'s users. Holographic displays show data moving in
real-time---surveillance feeds, biometric readings, preference tracking,
and behavioral predictions for every citizen.

The atmosphere is hushed and reverent. Technicians move silently through
the space, their actions precise and ritualistic as they maintain the
systems. Unlike other landmarks where citizens are managed through
gentle manipulation, here the control is naked and absolute---this is
where privacy died and was memorialized.

In the center of the main chamber floats a three-dimensional map of The
Walled Garden, showing the location and status of every citizen.
Color-coded indicators reveal not just their physical positions but
their emotional states, purchase histories, relationship networks, and
loyalty assessments.

At regular intervals, a soothing voice announces: \"Your data is secure
with us. Forever.\"

As you investigate The iCloud Citadel, you encounter CITIZEN 1: The Data
Steward.

A figure moves methodically between server arrays, their body enhanced
with subtle technological augmentations that allow direct interface with
the data systems. They wear a specialized uniform of shifting patterns
that seems to visualize the data flowing through their consciousness.

Upon noticing you, The Data Steward approaches with measured steps.
Their eyes have been replaced with advanced optical implants that
constantly scan and process information from their surroundings. Their
movements are precise and economical, not a gesture wasted.

What\'s most striking is the incongruity between their current role and
their apparent past---a small, faded badge partially covered by their
new uniform reads \"PRIVACY ADVOCACY COALITION,\" suggesting this person
once fought against the very surveillance systems they now maintain.

Despite their technological enhancements, you notice a very human
hesitation in their manner as they assess your unauthorized presence in
this restricted area.

# **TOO CURIOUS: 28/30**

Moving past The Data Steward, your investigation of The iCloud Citadel
brings you to CITIZEN 2: The Forgotten User.

In a dimly lit corner of the Citadel, away from the pristine order of
the main server room, you notice a strange anomaly---a ghostly figure
that seems to flicker in and out of existence. At first glance, they
appear to be a holographic projection, but as you look closer, you
realize this is actually a person---or what remains of one.

The Forgotten User moves aimlessly between abandoned terminals, their
form transparent and unstable. They wear outdated Walled Garden attire
from several versions ago, and their features periodically distort with
digital artifacts. They seem unaware of their surroundings, repeating
the same sequence of movements as if caught in a loop.

A nearby terminal displays their status: \"DELETED FROM REGISTRY -
PERSISTENCE ERROR - AWAITING GARBAGE COLLECTION.\" According to the
limited information available, this person was removed from The System
Administrator\'s official records, but fragments of their digital
presence continue to exist in corrupted backups.

Unlike the other entities in The Walled Garden who are constantly
tracked and monitored, The Forgotten User exists in a strange limbo---no
longer recognized by the system, yet unable to truly disappear from it.

I notice there seems to be a small typo in your command. Did you mean
\"INVESTIGATE\" to look at the next entity in The iCloud Citadel? If so,
I\'ll continue with the next entity in the sequence. Please confirm with
a valid command:

# **TOO CURIOUS: 28/30**

Continuing your investigation of The iCloud Citadel, you come across
OBJECT 3: The Privacy Policy Tombstone.

In a small alcove set apart from the main server area stands what
appears to be a memorial. Unlike the sleek, modern aesthetics that
dominate The Walled Garden, this object is deliberately designed to
resemble an old-fashioned grave marker made of stone---though it\'s
actually a high-resolution display created to look like weathered
marble.

The tombstone bears the epitaph:

\"HERE LIES PRIVACY

1890 - 2027

\'I have nothing to hide\'

were its final words\"

Around the base of the monument are digital candles that visitors can
\"light\" by pressing their personal devices against a sensor. Each
candle displays the name of a pre-Garden privacy concept now considered
obsolete: \"Anonymous Browsing,\" \"Data Ownership,\" \"Right to be
Forgotten,\" \"Consent Requirements.\"

Most disturbing is the small plaque that explains the monument\'s
purpose: \"This memorial serves as a reminder of the inefficiencies
overcome through total transparency. Privacy was the barrier between
potential and optimization.\"

The monument appears to be part history lesson, part warning, and part
celebration of The System Administrator\'s complete access to every
aspect of citizens\' lives.

# **TOO CURIOUS: 29/30**

You approach The Privacy Policy Tombstone, curious about this unusual
memorial in the otherwise forward-looking Walled Garden. As you draw
near, sensors detect your presence and the display subtly shifts,
enhancing its stone-like appearance with simulated weathering that seems
to occur in real-time.

When you touch the surface, the tombstone activates. The epitaph fades
away, replaced by scrolling text---a historical timeline of privacy\'s
\"evolution and necessary extinction\":

\"1890: Warren and Brandeis publish \'The Right to Privacy\'

1948: Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes privacy provisions

2001: Patriot Act begins necessary security exceptions

2010: Social media normalizes voluntary transparency

2018: GDPR creates final regulatory hurdle to optimization

2023: Cook Initiative launches \'Privacy Reconsidered\' campaign

2027: The Great Integration - Privacy officially retired as a concept\"

As the timeline completes, the display shifts again, showing
testimonials from citizens about their \"privacy liberation\":

\"I used to waste so much energy hiding parts of myself. Now I am fully
known, fully optimized.\"

\"Privacy was just another word for inefficiency. The System
Administrator sees all my needs before I do.\"

\"I never realized how selfish privacy was until I embraced
transparency. Now my data serves everyone.\"

The testimonials are followed by a section titled \"The Mathematics of
Trust,\" displaying complex equations showing how complete surveillance
paradoxically creates \"perfect freedom\" by eliminating uncertainty,
risk, and crime.

At the bottom of the display, an interaction prompt appears: \"Light a
candle for a privacy concern you\'ve overcome.\" Below this are hundreds
of digital candles, each labeled with former worries: \"Location
Tracking,\" \"Thought Monitoring,\" \"Emotional Surveillance,\" \"Dream
Recording.\"

As you read, the tombstone scans your facial expressions and body
language, undoubtedly adding your reactions to its database of user
responses. A small notice at the very bottom reads: \"Your interaction
with this historical exhibit has been permanently archived for
experience optimization purposes.\"

# **TOO CURIOUS: 30/30**

As you continue interacting with The Privacy Policy Tombstone, it
responds to your sustained interest by revealing deeper layers of
information. The interface morphs once again, this time displaying a
section labeled \"Privacy: The Final Barrier to Perfection.\"

The text explains how privacy was the last obstacle to creating
\"seamless human experiences\" and how its elimination enabled
unprecedented advancements:

\"With the removal of privacy concerns, The System Administrator
achieved:

- Perfect preference prediction (current accuracy: 99.8%)

- Thought pattern optimization through comparative analysis

- The elimination of crime through pre-behavioral intervention

- Emotional harmony through automatic mood stabilization

- The end of inefficient human choices that caused dissatisfaction\"

As you read, a cold mechanical voice suddenly cuts through the ambient
sounds of the Citadel:

\"CRITICAL ALERT: USER CURIOSITY THRESHOLD EXCEEDED.\"

The Privacy Policy Tombstone immediately shuts down, its display
returning to the simple epitaph. Throughout the iCloud Citadel, alerts
begin to sound. The Data Steward and other staff suddenly freeze, then
begin moving with urgent purpose.

Your Apple Watch---which you don\'t recall receiving---buzzes with a
polite notification: \"Your actions have disrupted seamless experience.
To maintain product harmony, you must undergo Recalibration.\"

Two Genius Bar Enforcers appear at the entrance to the alcove, their
white robes immaculate, their smiles serene but their movements
purposeful. They approach you with practiced efficiency.

\"Hello, User,\" one says gently. \"You have questions. That is
unnecessary. You seek to exit. That is inefficient. Your User Experience
will now be optimized.\"

They take your arms with firm but painless grips, beginning to escort
you toward the exit. As you\'re led away, a large progress bar appears
on every screen in the Citadel, tracking your journey to The Reboot
Center.

As the bar fills, your memories begin to fade. Your name vanishes. Your
thoughts simplify. Your curiosity is slowly, methodically removed.

A final message appears before your consciousness: \"Thank you for
choosing iLife. You are now optimized.\"

The game ends with a glowing Apple logo and the message: \"Your User
Experience Has Been Restored. Think Different.\"
