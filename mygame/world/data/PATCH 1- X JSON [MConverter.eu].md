civilization. Built atop the scorched husk of Texas, X is Elon Musk's
personal vision of a post-democratic utopia: a walled city of glass and
steel where progress is law and criticism is treason. Access is limited
to those who contribute---engineers, influencers, and \'high-value\'
individuals receive Residency Clearance, while lower-tier workers live
in Manufacturing Hubs under strict productivity quotas. Those unwilling
to participate in the grand experiment are exiled to the Free Zone or
forcibly enrolled in The Trials.\",
