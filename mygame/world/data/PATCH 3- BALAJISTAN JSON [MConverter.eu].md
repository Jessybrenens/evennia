\"overview\": \"Welcome to Balajistan, the first fully on-chain nation,
founded by exiled tech prophet Balaji Srinivasan after he fled the US
legal system. Here, every interaction is a smart contract, every breath
is tokenized, and \'exit\' is the only remaining right. Balajistan
exists in a perpetual state of relocation, its oceanic flotilla shifting
coordinates to avoid regulation, taxation, and extradition treaties.
Citizenship is granted only to those who stake significant assets and
provide genetic proof that they are not \'NPCs\' (Non-Propertied
Citizens). Those who fail to pay transaction fees or criticize the
system are rug-pulled from existence. There is no government, only
protocol. Decisions are made via on-chain governance votes, weighted
according to individual net worth and engagement metrics. The weak exit.
The strong HODL.\",
